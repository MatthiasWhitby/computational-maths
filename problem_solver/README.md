# Problem Solver Framework
This project is a basic, structured approach to solving algorithmic and mathematical problems.

## Purpose
This project is part of my learning process. Although basic, I am using it as a way to understand the foundations of GitHub and to generate a repeatable workflow that can be reused for mathematical and algorithmic problems which over time can evolve as my thought process changes.

## Current State
The first iteration will be intentionally minimal in order to have a starting point that still covers a wide array of problems.

## Future Plans
 - Add specialised structured solutions for different problem types
 - Include worked examples
