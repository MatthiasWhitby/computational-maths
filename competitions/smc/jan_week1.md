## Question 21
Out of a selection of numbers, which does not have a root in the form $x + y\sqrt{2}$.

### Key Idea
The main idea is to square the given form to calculate the correct format of any answers then compare to the list of numbers.

### Solution
$(x + y\sqrt{2})^2$ = $x^2$ + $2xy\sqrt{2}$ + $2y^2$<br>
Rearrange to -> $(x^2 + 2y^2)$ + $2xy\sqrt{2}$. This is the format all correct answers should be in.<br>
Every answer in the list is written as z + $12\sqrt{2}$. Therefore 12 = 2xy -> 6 = xy<br>
As x and y are positive integers the possible cases are: x = 1, y = 6; x = 6, y = 1; x = 2; y = 3; x = 3, y = 2.<br>
Now you solve for the first term of each correct answer:<br>
When x = 1, y = 6 - > (1)^2 + 2(6)^2 = 1 + 72 = 73<br>
When x = 6, y = 1 - > (6)^2 + 2(1)^2 = 36 + 2 = 38<br>
When x = 2, y = 3 - > (2)^2 + 2(3)^2 = 4 + 18 = 22<br>
When x = 3, y = 2 - > (3)^2 + 2(2)^2 = 9 + 8 = 17<br>

The numbers which have a root in the form $x + y\sqrt{2}$ are therefore:
73 + $12\sqrt{2}$<br>
38 + $12\sqrt{2}$<br>
22 + $12\sqrt{2}$<br>
17 + $12\sqrt{2}$<br>
This leaves only one option: D - 54 + $12\sqrt{2}$

### Conclusion
Final answer is D - 54 + $12\sqrt{2}$
