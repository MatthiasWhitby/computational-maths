## Question 21
Out of a selection of numbers, which does not have a root in the form x + y$\sqrt{2}$.

### Key Idea
The main idea is to square the given form to calculate the correct format of any answers then compare to the list of numbers.

### Solution
(x + y$\sqrt{2}$)^2 = x^2 + 2xy$\sqrt{2}$ + 2y^2
Rearrange to -> (x^2 + 2y^2) + 2xy$\sqrt{2}$. This is the format all correct answers should be in.
Every answer in the list is written as z + 12$\sqrt{2}$. Therefore 12 = 2xy -> 6 = xy
As x and y are positive integers the possible cases are: x = 1, y = 6; x = 6, y = 1; x = 2; y = 3; x = 3, y = 2.
Now you solve for the first term of each correct answer:
When x = 1, y = 6 - > (1)^2 + 2(6)^2 = 1 + 72 = 73
When x = 6, y = 1 - > (6)^2 + 2(1)^2 = 36 + 2 = 38
When x = 2, y = 3 - > (2)^2 + 2(3)^2 = 4 + 18 = 22
When x = 3, y = 2 - > (3)^2 + 2(2)^2 = 9 + 8 = 17

The numbers which have a root in the form x + y$\sqrt{2}$ are therefore:
73 + 12$\sqrt{2}$
38 + 12$\sqrt{2}$
22 + 12$\sqrt{2}$
17 + 12$\sqrt{2}$
This leaves only one option: D - 54 + 12$\sqrt{2}$

### Conclusion
Final answer is D - 54 + 12$\sqrt{2}$
