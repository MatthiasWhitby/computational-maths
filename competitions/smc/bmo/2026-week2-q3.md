# BMO 2018 Round 1

## Question 3
What are all the possible numbers which are a product of 2 numbers that differ by 9 and 2 numbers that differ by 6

### Key Idea
Setting up an equality equation and completing the square, which I did not initially consider because I presumed there would have been a pattern in the factors of certain numbers.

### Solution
The 2 numbers Ares picks can be written as:<br>a, a-9<br><br>
The 2 numbers Grace picks can be written as: g, g-6<br><br>
The product of each of these (T) can be written as:<br>
T = a(a-9) = g(g-6)<br>
 -> T = $a^2 - 9a = g^2 - 6g$<br>
Complete the square:<br>
$(a-9/2)^2 - 81/4 = (g-3)^2 - 9$<br>
To remove fractions, multiply all values by 4 and rearrange:<br>
$(2a - 9)^2 - (2g - 6)^2 = 45$<br>
Let A = 2a-9, G = 2g-6<br>
 -> $A^2 - G^2 = 45$<br>
 -> (A + G)(A - G) = 45<br>
All possible factors of 45 are: <br>
 - 1, 45<br>
 - -1, -45<br>
 - 3, 15<br>
 - -3, -15<br>
 - 5, 9<br>
 - -5, -9<br>
Now solve all simultaneous equations for all possible values of A e.g. A + G = 45, A - G = 1 etc. You get the possible A values (and subsequent a and a-9 values) of:<br>
 - A = 23, a = 16, a - 9 = 7<br>
 - A = -23, a = -7, a - 9 = -16<br>
 - A = 9, a = 9, a - 9 = 0<br>
 - A = -9, a = 0, a - 9 = -9<br>
 - A = 7, a = 8, a - 9 = -1<br>
 - A = -7, a = 1, a - 9 = -8<br>
By now solving you get all the possible products of: 112, 0, and -8<br>

### Conclusion
Therefore the final answer is T = -8, T = 0, and T = 112<br>

### Reflection
Next time I should recognise writing the equality equation in a different form.
