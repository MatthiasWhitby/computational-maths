# Algorithms
An algorithm set of instructions for solving a problem in steps. Can be used by computers but also in everyday life e.g. counting the number of people in a room. Can be made more efficient e.g. instead of counting one at a time, count two at a time.

## Big O
Big O describes the performance of an algorithm as the set of data that the algorithm uses increases. It ignores machine perfomance and focuses on the number of steps it takes to complete teh algorithm. Small incrememts are ignored e.g. O(n + 1) -> O(n).

## Runtime Complexities:
 - O(1) = constant time e.g. inserting at beginning of list
 - O(log n) = logarithmic time e.g. binary search
 - O(n) = linear time e.g. searching through a list
 - O(n log n) = quasilinear itme e.g. merge-sort
 - O(n^2) = quadratic time e.g. insertion sort
 - O(n!) = factorial time e.g. travelling salesman
